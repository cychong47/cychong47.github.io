The result is that most existing guidelines contain well over a hundred rules, sometimes with questionable justification. Some rules especially those that try to stipulate the use of white-space in programs, may have been introduced by personal preference; others are meants to prevent very specific and unlikely types of error from eariler coding efforts within the same organization.
효율적인 가이드라인이 되려면, rule의 개수는 적어야 하고, 쉽게 이해되고, 기억될 수 있을 만큼 명확해야 한다.

It should be considered routine practices, even for non-critical code development.
Many devlopers have been caught in the assumption that a warning was surely invalid, only to realize much later that the message was in fact valid for less obvious reasons.</p><p>Rule 1~2 gurantees the creation of a clear and trasnparent control flow structure that is easier to build, test and anazyze</p></content><p></p></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear</a></footer></body></html>
